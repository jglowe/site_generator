    Hello, world!

    I have decided to make a webcomic, for my own personal enjoyment and so I would have a reason to learn about building websites.

    I have posted some comics I drew a while ago and will add more eventually; I will be busy for the next few months.

    This blog will be primarily used for posting updates and information about the comic.

    Adios amigos!
