  title: About This Comic
  content: |
    I have made this webcomic as a way to show my comics to friends and acquaintances and to sharpen my website development skills.

    #### Who am I?

    I am a graduate of the University of Virginia with a degree in Computer Engineering. I am currently employed by a company that operates a diverse set of networking infrastructure. In my free time, I listen to audiobooks, play the piano, and cook.
    #### Technical Stuff

    If you are interested in how I made this website, [here is the link to the Github repository for this website](https://github.com/jglowe/comic_site).
